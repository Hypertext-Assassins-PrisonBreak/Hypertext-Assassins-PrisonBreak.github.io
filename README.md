# Welcome to Prison Break wiki!

## Introduction

The key points for this project were to develop an educational game for the audience of 10 to 12-year-old kids. The educational aspect of the game is to teach kids online safety. The project group consists of four members and one of the requirements was to develop the game in TypeScript. 

## The Game

The Game idea is top-down view Prison Break. In the game, the player has to move around with the character Freddy The Bear from one room to another. However, to complete the game player has to answer the internet-related questions by accessing them via terminals around the map. Questions are in English and Dutch languages.  

## Game Control

To move around the map, the player can use keyboard keys like WSAD and Arrows. To access the questions the player has to press the space key next to the terminal. Choosing the correct answer can be done by up and down arrows, W or S keys. To submit the answer, the player has to click enter.
